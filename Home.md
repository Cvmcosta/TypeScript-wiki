The TypeScript Wiki is for people who are interested in:

- [Debugging TypeScript problems](./debugging)
- [Using the compiler API](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API)
- [Wanting to contribute to the TypeScript codebase or to understand the compiler](./learn-the-compiler)

It is also used as a scratch-pad for one-off links which are useful when triaging GitHub issues. For example the [[FAQ]]

If you are after documentation on how to use TypeScript the language, or the build tool: please see: https://www.typescriptlang.org
